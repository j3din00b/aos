+ how [to|do] * play blackjack
- You start with two playing cards. The idea is to either decide to draw more, or keep your current hand.\n
^ Once you decide to hold, then the House (me) will do the same.\n
^ Whoever gets closest to 21 in value without going over, wins. If you go over 21, you loose instantly.
